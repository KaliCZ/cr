# Mastering code reviews

Over the past 10+ years, in total I've spent majority of my time doing code reviews. At least that's what GitHub statistics show :). Here are some things I look for in the diffs when checking pull requests and how I approach their resolution. I focus on some areas and patterns based on the frequency and severity of issues that I usually find there, this is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but rather "quality minimum". Note that I spent lot of time at [Mews](https://github.com/MewsSystems/developers) so the stuff here will definitely be biased and opinionated, gravitating towards backend development in C# using functional programming principles.
